(**TEST PLAN: Our test system automatically tests the fundamental
   functions for our wizard game with OUnit tests. These include the
   tests of making bets, initializing the deck, shuffling the deck,
   assigning cards, finishing and resetting the round, and more. The
   more complex functions, which only make subtle changes to the game
   state, were tested manually by comparing the gameplay of our wizard
   game with the expected gameplay mechanics as observed by veteran
   wizard players with a ruleset handy. The ruleset, which is provided
   in rules.txt and can be read by typing in 'rules' when prompted,
   proved quite useful to manually test the edge cases in card
   interactions, as there are many. We test the Player, Deck, Card,
   Table, Calculator, and Round modules, leaving only the Main and
   PrintFunct modules untested by OUnit. We developed our tests using
   black-box testing and glass-box testing where appropriate, as
   sometimes we knew there was an aspect to our implementation that we
   needed to test, such as edge cases with empty lists, hence we would
   use glass-box-testing, and sometimes we needed to check for the
   correctness of the output because it was not obvious how the output
   might be correct or incorrect based on the code alone, hence we used
   black-box testing to design those tests. We performed manual
   randomized testing for the functions in the Main module, as those
   functions often take keyboard input as inputs, meaning they need to
   be thoroughly protected from crashing on fuzzy inputs, which our
   manual testing proved they were. We manually tested every single
   input with randomized testing until it was impossible to break the
   code with a bad input. The reason this test plan demonstrates the
   correctness of the system is because the fundamental aspects of the
   system are tested modularly. These aspects which are correct in their
   modular setting are then combined in the manual tests, in which we
   carefully check for any conditions that might cause functions which
   pass their tests in modularity to fail in combinatio with others
   functions.*)
